# the TrackR original firmware

This directory contains a copy of the orginal TrackR firmware.
You should be able to revert back to the original firmware using Nordic's nRF-Go Studio (Windows PC only).
See Nordic's manual for operation details.

While it should not be necessary to update/repair the SoftDevice image on the TrackR.  
If you do decide to update the SoftDevice, use SD V7.2.0.
